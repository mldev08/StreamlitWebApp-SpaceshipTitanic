# Streamlit Web App Spaceship Titanic
In this project, I demonstrated how to present machine learning as a web application.


## Files
- `web_app.py`: streamlit app file
- `model.py`: script for generating the Random Forest classifier model
- `train.csv` and `model_weights.mw`: data file and pre-trained model
- `requirements.txt`: package requirements files

## How to run the application locally (win)

```shell
$ python -m venv venv
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ streamlit run web_app.py
```
Open http://localhost:8501 to view the app.

## Docker

in progress...
